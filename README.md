# waifetch

[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/) but with waifus

## Installation

Because this is a ~~beta~~ alpha version, there isn't an official installation script yet.
To test it out, git clone the repo, cd into it, and run `./hentaifetch`.
I've tested it out on Arch, but theoretically it should work on any distro.
Just make sure neofetch and jq are installed (see PKGBUILD file and the dependencies field).

## Usage

WIP section lol
